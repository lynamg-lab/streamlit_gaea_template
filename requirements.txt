# requirements.txt — Streamlit GAEA Template
# Minimal set of dependencies needed to run the dashboards.
# Pin loosely (>=) for updates while staying compatible.

# --- Core runtime ---
streamlit>=1.36
pandas>=2.0
altair>=5.0

# --- Map tab (choropleth) ---
# If you don't use the Map tab, you can comment Plotly out.
plotly>=5.0

# --- Notes ---
# - numpy is pulled in by pandas automatically.
# - No geospatial libs required: Plotly uses country names (locationmode='country names').
# - If corporate proxies block pip, consider using a constraints file maintained by IT.
